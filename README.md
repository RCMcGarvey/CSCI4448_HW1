# Project 2
Adam Rosa and Ryan McGarvey

## Runing
Clone the repo we are assuming that you are using IntelliJ. If you open the project in IntelliJ you should be ale to run the program right off the bat. If not you might have to create a new run config. To do that in IntelliJ go up to the top menu bar. Next to the hammer there should be an option to select "add a new configuration". Do this then there should be a plus button in ther top left corner of a new window. Hit that, select application config, and set the running class to Main.java. Now you should be able to execute the code.
  
## Problems Encountered
Implementing the strategy pattern because it involves abstracting away a concrete method, but the superclass still needs to know which concrete method to use. \
Observer chains: Observering an observable that is observing a different observable.
  
## Assumptions
Our observer structures are simple enough where we do not need to implement subject interfaces. \
Drop bears are real and not a joke.

## Runing
  Clone the repo we are assuming that you are using IntelliJ. If you open the project in intellij you should be ale to run the program right off the bat. If not you might have to create a new run config. To do that in IntelliJ go up to the top menu bar. Next to the hammer there should be an option to select "add a new configuration". Do this then there should be a plus button in ther top left corner of a new window. Hit that select application config and sya trhet the running class is Main.java. Now you should be able to run.
